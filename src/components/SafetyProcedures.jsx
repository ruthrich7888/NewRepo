      <p>
        Your safety is our top priority. Here are the safety procedures and
        protocols that every employee should be aware of:
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        <p>
          Our <strong>Safety Procedures</strong> are designed to ensure a safe
          and secure environment for all employees. We take workplace safety
          seriously and have established clear guidelines to help prevent
          accidents, injuries, and other safety hazards.
        </p>
        <p>
          All employees must undergo safety training as part of their onboarding
          process. This training will cover key safety protocols, emergency
          procedures, and specific safety equipment usage required for your
          role.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>Workplace Safety Guidelines</strong> cover a wide range of
          practices, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE),
          proper lifting techniques, and adherence to safety protocols when
          operating machinery or working in hazardous environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case of an emergency, employees must follow the emergency
          evacuation plan, which includes designated exit routes and meeting
          points. The company has trained emergency responders available in case
          of injury or medical need.
        </p>
        <p>
          All workspaces must be kept free of clutter, and employees must ensure
          that any hazards are reported immediately to the safety officer.
          Maintaining a clean and organized workspace contributes significantly
          to overall safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compliance with safety procedures is mandatory. Any employee found
          violating safety protocols may face disciplinary actions, up to and
          including termination.
