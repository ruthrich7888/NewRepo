          The <strong>IT Policies</strong> section covers the rules and
          guidelines for the use of company technology, software, and hardware.
          Adhering to these policies is crucial to maintaining a secure,
          efficient, and professional work environment.

          All employees must follow company procedures for handling sensitive
          data. This includes ensuring that passwords and account information
          are kept secure and not shared with unauthorized individuals. Any
          breaches or security threats must be reported immediately to the IT
          department.
        </p>
        <p>
          Employees are not permitted to install unauthorized software on
          company devices. Any software installation must be approved by the IT
          department to ensure compatibility, security, and performance
          standards are maintained.
        </p>
        <p>
          Access to the company's network is a privilege and should be used
          responsibly. Employees must adhere to guidelines regarding internet
          usage, file sharing, and data storage to protect both personal and
          company information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The use of personal devices for work-related tasks should be minimized
          and strictly controlled. If using personal devices, ensure they are
          properly secured and comply with company security standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any attempt to bypass security protocols, intentionally or
          unintentionally, will result in immediate disciplinary action. The IT
          department is available for troubleshooting and support but should be
          contacted according to the established procedures for any technical
          issues.
