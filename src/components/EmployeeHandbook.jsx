        Welcome to the Employee Handbook. Here youâ€™ll find all the important
        policies, rules, and procedures to ensure a successful and safe
        experience working with us.

          The <strong>Employee Handbook</strong> is a vital resource for all new
          employees. It outlines essential company policies, expectations, and
          guidelines that you must follow during your time with us. This
          document helps you understand your responsibilities, rights, and how
          to effectively contribute to the success of the company.
        </p>
        <p>
          All new employees must complete the mandatory one-week training
          program before they are allowed to perform any work-related tasks.
          This training is a crucial part of the onboarding process, providing
          you with the necessary tools, resources, and knowledge to perform your
          job with competence and confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>Work Commencement Policy</strong> requires that all
          company-issued equipment be set up and in full working condition
          before any official duties can begin. This ensures you have the
          necessary tools to perform your role effectively. Please note that you
          will not be authorized to begin working until all required equipment
          is received and fully configured.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our <strong>Equipment Ownership and Usage Policy</strong> ensures that
          all company-issued equipment is solely for your use and must not be
          transferred or lent to any third party. Only equipment purchased
          through approved company vendors can be used to maintain compatibility
          and compliance with company standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Handling Company Funds</strong> is a critical responsibility.
          Any funds allocated for equipment procurement must be utilized within
          24 hours of receipt. Delaying or misusing company funds for personal
          purposes is prohibited and may result in severe consequences,
          including legal action if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Attendance and Work Schedule</strong> expectations are clear:
          employees must adhere to their assigned schedules. Failing to report
          to work or neglecting duties without prior approval will be treated as
          misconduct and addressed accordingly. Timely communication about
          schedule changes is essential.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you experience <strong>Equipment Damage</strong>, you must submit a
          written statement with details of the damage and circumstances. Only
          then will a replacement be considered. If no satisfactory explanation
          is provided, the request may be denied, or further disciplinary action
          may follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          We take our <strong>Commitment to Compliance</strong> seriously. These
          policies are binding, and non-compliance will lead to disciplinary
          action, potentially including termination or legal referrals.
